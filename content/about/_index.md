### The Roadmap

![Our Roadmap](/alumni-network/images/alumni-initiative-roadmap.png)

### The Vision

We believe students and PhDs at Munich Center for Technology in Society, whether past or present, need a space to connect beyond university and bring the best of STS into the world.

That’s why we started this initiative for an alumni network.

### The Mission

Our goal is to found an association (“eingetragener Verein”) to enable students and PhDs at Munich Center for Technology in Society to stay connected, for career orientation, peer-to-peer networking, living the MCTS spirit and so much more.

### Possible Activities

We could imagine a range of activities such as:
- Organising an alumni homecoming
- Establishing career mentoring
- Publishing a job market
- Put together essential readings in STS for our first years
- Foster professional exchange
- Share stories from the network through newsletters and social media
- Hold Best Thesis or Essay Awards
- and so much more!

### Who are we?

We are a group of current and former students of the Munich Center for Technology in Society at the Technical University of Munich. We are united by the idea to find ways fostering a long-lasting exchange of alumni, current students and PhDs of the MCTS — basically, how to hold the MCTS family together in the longterm. Inspired by the successful example of an alumni network of our previous studies we started this initiative. <br><br>Please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at <a href='mailto:alumni-network@mcts.tum.de'>alumni-network@mcts.tum.de</a>!
