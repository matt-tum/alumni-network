### The Vision

We believe students and PhDs at Munich Center for Technology in Society, whether past or present, need a space to connect beyond university and bring the best of STS into the world.

That’s why we started this initiative for an alumni network.

### The Mission

Our goal is to found an association (“eingetragener Verein”) to enable students and PhDs at Munich Center for Technology in Society to stay connected, for career orientation, peer-to-peer networking, living the MCTS spirit and so much more.

### Possible Activities

We could imagine a range of activities such as:
- Organising an alumni homecoming
- Establishing career mentoring
- Publishing a job market
- Put together essential readings in STS for our first years
- Foster professional exchange
- Share stories from the network through newsletters and social media
- Hold Best Thesis or Essay Awards
- and so much more!

### What's the timeline as of today?

Up until recently, we've completed the early preparations by involving stakeholders (such as the MCTS and the Studienbüro) and laying the legal groundwork.

Now it's time for *Phase 1* and your involvement: to found an association we not only legally need at least 7 people. Most importantly, we need your support and ideas how this alumni network should look like. Our aim is to found the alumni network by the end of 2020 / early 2021.


### Who are we?

We are Dominik Wedber, RESET '19, Fabian Kuntz, RESET '18, and Matthias Meller, RESET '20. Right before the pandemic got started we came together to brainstorm about ways to foster a long-lasting exchange of alumni and current students as well as PhDs of the MCTS — basically, how to hold the MCTS family together in the longterm. Inspired by the successful example of an alumni network of our previous studies we started this initiative. <br><br>Please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at <a href='mailto:alumni-network@mcts.tum.de'>alumni-network@mcts.tum.de</a>!
